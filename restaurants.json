The variety of starters, especially the kebabs, was mind-blowing. Each dish in the main course felt authentic and was packed with flavor. The staff was extremely courteous and attentive, making sure our barbecue was always full and our needs were met. The ambiance is lively and beautifully themed. A must-visit for anyone who loves a good buffet with endless, delicious options. Highly recommended!",

So go on a week day to enjoy the service also.\n\nThe drinks were nice. But the food portions are small so order accordingly. I ordered a Chicken soup which was too pungent to drink \u2026. Had to leave it. The pasta was nice and also the chicken dish. A place for a one time visit.",

There is so much seafood to eat. I\u2019ve probably had at least five different types of shrimp prepared different ways. The sushi is very very fresh and is very creative. The Indian food is also very fresh. The only thing I was disappointed by was the dim sum!  My waiter Rahul took very good care of me!",

        "Reviews": "7504 reviews. Recommended: Bukhara at ITC Maurya is undoubtedly one of Delhi\u2019s most iconic dining destinations, known for its rustic ambiance and legendary North-West Frontier cuisine. As a vegetarian, the menu is limited but thoughtfully curated, with standout dishes like too much hyped -the Dal Bukhara \u2013 slow-cooked to perfection \u2013 and the Paneer Tikka, which is rich, smoky, and indulgent. And off course Naan - Bukhara which is big enough for 7-8 persons\n\nThe flavors are authentic and the quality is excellent, with every dish cooked in traditional clay ovens, offering a taste that\u2019s hard to match elsewhere.\n\nHowever, the experience comes with a steep price tag. While the food is certainly enjoyable, the but quite expensive for the portion sizes and variety offered. It\u2019s ideal for a one-time splurge or a special occasion, but not a go-to spot for regular vegetarian diners.\n\nVerdict:\n\u2714\ufe0f Excellent taste and quality\n\u2714\ufe0f Unique rustic charm and open kitchen experience\n\u274c Limited vegetarian variety\n\u274c Prices on the higher side",

The glass budha statue right in the middle of the dinning area the place adds a soothing touch to whole experience.\n\nWith alcohol  from all parts of japan and world there something for everyone.\n\nWe started with Tuna Tataki as cold appetizers and Megu's Shrimpop as hot appetizers.  Tuna tataki was amazing the shrimpop were just ok.\n\nNext on the table prawn nilgiri sushi roll, it was one of the best we ever had, in mains we ordered Grilled Prawn and grilled baby chicken. chicken we found to be on the sweeter end of the spectrum.\n\nThe highlight of the day was the Azuki Almond crumble tart, just amazing and should never be missed\n\nA definite recommendation for japanese/Asian fine dine for your special occasions.",

Served with a fresh, aromatic coriander chutney, each bite was bursting with flavor. For the main course, we ordered saag paneer, butter chicken, wok-fried rice, lachha paratha, and tandoori rotis. Every dish was beautifully presented, generously portioned, and packed with rich, balanced flavors. The level of spice was perfect\u2014even our kids thoroughly enjoyed the meal.\n\nOverall, Annamaya delivered an exceptional dining experience in the heart of Hyatt Andaz.

        "Reviews": "10847 reviews. Recommended: I visited this place the second time. the last time was two yeras back.. I had liked it very much, but this time not so much. First of all, food was completely ordinary and expensive. We ordered Aglio Olio Pasta, which was very watery and soggy. Beverages were too sweet. Only good thing was pad thai noodles, this particular dish was perfect. Now come to ambience, their USP is revolving place. Ok good, but they don't improve interiors. Same old chairs and tables and nothing asthetic. New restaurants out there are offering beautiful ambinece now a days. Staff behaviour was like- this place runs by itself, why do anything. We ordered dimsums for starters but it was served after we finished our main course meal...they were not even well dressed or well behaved. I won't recommend this restaurant at this kind of menu price. We can get much better for this price. But definitely one can visit at least once for the revolving view of Central Delhi.",
